Hi there! My name is Alexandros Benetatos. I'm currently looking for new opportunities and am particularly interested in pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science, with a focus on Generative 3D systems. I'm excited about the potential of creating realistic virtual human agents interacting with immersive 3D environments.

I received my MSc in Computer Science (Machine Learning) from the [National Technical University of Athens (NTUA)](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) and in close collaboration with [Deeplab](https://deeplab.ai/), advised by Prof. [Petros Maragos](https://robotics.ntua.gr/members/maragos/). I also completed my undergraduate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at NTUA.

After graduation, I spent a great year as a Research Scientist at [Steel Perlot](https://steelperlot.com/), focusing on developing personalized text-to-image technologies in the field of generative AI.

Aside from my research pursuits in CS, I am passionate about educational robotics. For the past decade, I have coached numerous student teams, leading them to win awards at both national and international competitions. Itâ€™s been a joy to inspire young students to delve into complex STEM fields and help them achieve their best.

Reflecting on my past, I have many fond memories of representing Greece in robotics and physics Olympiads during high school, where my interests in computer science began.

<i>Feel free to reach out via email or connect with me on LinkedIn. I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations.</i>
