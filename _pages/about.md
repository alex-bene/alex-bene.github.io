Hi there! I'm a first year [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/) Ph.D. student at [IMAGINE](https://imagine-lab.enpc.fr/) ([ENPC](https://ecoledesponts.fr/)) and [Real Virtual Humans](https://virtualhumans.mpi-inf.mpg.de/) ([University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/)) groups supervised by [Gül Varol](https://gulvarol.github.io/) and [Gerard Pons-Moll](https://virtualhumans.mpi-inf.mpg.de/people/pons-moll.html). My research sits in the intersection between 3D computer vision, computer graphics, and machine learning, with a focus on synthesizing human-object interactions in 3D.

Before my Ph.D., I received my MSc in Computer Science (Machine Learning) from the [National Technical University of Athens (NTUA)](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) and in close collaboration with [Deeplab](https://deeplab.ai/), advised by Prof. [Petros Maragos](https://robotics.ntua.gr/members/maragos/). I also completed my undergraduate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at NTUA.

After graduation, I spent a great year as a Research Scientist at [Steel Perlot](https://steelperlot.com/), focusing on developing personalized text-to-image technologies in the field of generative AI.

Aside from my research pursuits in CS, I am passionate about educational robotics. For the past decade, I have coached numerous student teams, leading them to win awards at both national and international competitions. It’s been a joy to inspire young students to delve into complex STEM fields and help them achieve their best.

Reflecting on my past, I have many fond memories of representing Greece in robotics and physics Olympiads during high school, where my interests in computer science began.

<i>Feel free to reach out via email or connect with me on LinkedIn. I am always open to new collaborations.</i>
